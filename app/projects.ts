            "I really learned how to set a pace during this project. There weren't many days I didn't finish a full crud operation from back to front. Of course the rest of the day was spent hunting new bugs... However I really managed to find my groove implementing features.",
            "I'm a person with great ambitions! I've always known this, however it can really interfere at times when I take on way too much. There are hundreds of lines of commented out code in this project for things I just didn't have the time to polish. I can't wait to slowly implement these as time goes on!",
            "During this project week I found a few people coming to me to ask questions, this was a first! I wasn't always able to help, but I found that taking the time away from my project and helping others for a few minutes with theirs was a major boost to my productivity as well as theirs. WIN WIN. It was a lot of fun to be working solo yet staying in touch with the whole team and working together to debug.",
            "The biggest thing I had learned while working on this project is to start with the basics. Everyone wants a flashy app that does a bunch of cool things, but without a proper backbone - it's useless."

In this sprint I managed to complete 4 full CRUD features and implement every bonus feature listed as an option. It was a ton of fun to add in new features I had never worked with before like google maps and react-calendar. The app is designed off of the AirBnB team's beautiful CSS skills. What makes it stand out is that there is no cost and absolutely unlimited possibilities for what a user can share with their community!",
