In this sprint I managed to complete 4 full CRUD features and implement every bonus feature listed as an option. It was a ton of fun to add in new features I had never worked with before like google maps and react-calendar. The app is designed off of the AirBnB team's beautiful CSS skills. What makes it stand out is that there is no cost and absolutely unlimited possibilities for what a user can share with their community!",
