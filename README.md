# This portfolio was made with [Remix.Run](https://remix.run/)
- Check it out, it was seriously fun to work with.

## I created this to learn as well as make something a little more interesting than my initial boiler plate portfolio. 
- While working on it I knew it would be beneficial to learn a few new technologies. So I learned :
  - Typescript
  - Remix.Run 
  - Prisma
  - React-Spring Parallax

## Some things I struggled with
- Server side rendering: It seemed like everything had to go inside a useEffect
- Typescript: Type declarations can be infuriating at times but by the end I've found it's really not much to do and it saves way more time than it takes to implement. 
- Parallax: I wish I never did this, it's still there solely because I'm stubborn. It's very difficult to make it seemless and even harder to make it look ok on different screen sizes.

## Things to do
- I still have to add my admin page so that I can remove any innappropriate posts, but I'm optimistic that there won't be any
- Touch up CSS here and there
